# VRM Avatar Clothing Configurator

A 3D web experience where users can explore clothing on a VRM avatar. The platform allows for interactive outfit changes and platform rotation, creating an engaging shopping experience. This project aims to revolutionize how designers present their clothing ideas, allowing them to see dynamic, realistic garments on avatars with real-time effects, physics, and animations.

## ðŸš€ Project Vision

As the world moves increasingly online, designers need more than just static images to stand out. This platform empowers creators to present their work in the most compelling way possibleâ€”through **immersive, real-time 3D technology**. With virtual avatars, cloth physics, and dynamic interactions, designers can:

- **Pitch ideas** with greater impact by showcasing their work in a lifelike, interactive environment.
- Build **social credibility and influence** by pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in digital fashion.
- **Shock and awe** audiences and stakeholders by demonstrating the potential of this technology in revolutionizing the future of e-commerce.

The platform is not just about displaying clothingâ€”itâ€™s about elevating the way we think about design, creativity, and online presentation. Whether youâ€™re looking to make an impression on investors or create a viral moment on social media, this tool gives designers the **edge** to break through the noise.

Currently users are able to:
- View **3D clothing** on a virtual avatar that moves and rotates on a platform.
- Experience **realistic cloth physics** and dynamic shading with custom shaders.
- Seamlessly switch between outfits on the avatar with **preloaded 3D models**.
- Customize their own avatars for a more personalized shopping experience.

## Key Technologies

# Thank you to Pixiv/Three-VRM for making the speed of this project possible.

React: Provides the structure for the user interface and interaction.
React Three Fiber: A React-based renderer for Three.js, making it easy to work with 3D models and environments in a declarative way.
Three.js: The core 3D library that powers the scene, camera, and objects.
GSAP: Handles animations for the avatar and platform rotation, adding smooth transitions and effects.
Leva: For real-time controls and parameter adjustments.
GLTF & FBX Loaders: To load and manage 3D models and animations, enabling the seamless integration of Mixamo animations and other 3D assets.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

3D Interactive Platform: Users can rotate the platform and change outfits dynamically.

Shader-Based Visuals: Custom shaders enhance the appearance of certain objects, offering unique visual effects like stripes and disks.

Outfit Switching: Smooth transitions between outfits with preloaded avatars to reduce loading times and enhance the experience.

Dynamic Camera: The camera automatically adjusts and returns to its original position based on user interaction, providing an intuitive user experience.

Mixamo Animations: Bring the avatar to life with realistic animations that enhance the userâ€™s ability to see how clothes move and fit in real-time.

Customizable Controls: Use Leva for real-time adjustments to shader effects, lighting, and avatar positioning.
